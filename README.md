# bsgalone

Yet another copy of a famous game which will be probably not as polished and not as fun as the original. This time we try out: BSGO.

# Installation

## Prerequisite

This projects uses:

- [google test](https://github.com/google/googletest): installation instructions [here](https://www.eriksmistad.no/getting-started-with-google-test-on-ubuntu/), a simple `sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev` should be enough.
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/): installation instructions [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/355565/how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-cmake-from-the-command-line), a simple `apt-get` should also be enough.
- [eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page): installation instructions [here](https://www.cyberithub.com/how-to-install-eigen3-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa/) for Ubuntu 20.04, a simple `sudo apt install libeigen3-dev` should be enough.

## Instructions

- Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:Knoblauchpilze/pge-app.git`.
- Clone dependencies:
  - [core_utils](https://github.com/Knoblauchpilze/core_utils)
  - [maths_utils](https://github.com/Knoblauchpilze/maths_utils)
- Go to the project's directory `cd ~/path/to/the/repo`.
- Compile: `make run`.

Don't forget to add `/usr/local/lib` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to be able to load shared libraries at runtime. This is handled automatically when using the `make run` target (which internally uses the [run.sh](data/run.sh) script).

# What is the game about?

The goal is to have a 2d top view space shooter where the user can jump from systems to systems and fight enemies while mining resources and upgrading their ship.

# Useful links

About the entity component system, this [link](https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratch) is useful. Also found [this](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/) which seems more advanced so we might come back to it later.
